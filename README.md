# Emoji Match
## Turn the cards, match the Emojis, save the day!

### About
The Emoji Match game is coursework for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. I was provided with a basic HTML and CSS file, and given a product specification and the rest is left up to the participant. I decided to go with Emojis as it was a bit more aesthetic than the standard icons provided. 

### I WANT TO PLAY IT!
Alright, alright! Steady mate! Play it on my Codepen --->https://codepen.io/JABedford/pen/vRrvwE

#### First Submit
I had struggled in particular with a few elements of the Javascript section. My timer did not work as expected, and also it was possible to "cheat" the game and double click the cards to pass without having to match anything.

I also encountered an issue with the game not resetting properly when it was completed and therefore the cards did not reshuffle.

Subsequently, it was picked up on in my code review. I was given a small piece of advice for each problem, but ultimately I decided to start from the start again and rewrite what I had done. I made this decision
purely for the fact that when trying to fix the various bugs throughout, I kept thinking of shorter ways of doing various things. This wasn't an easy decision seeing as I had already invested so much time
in doing the original script, however I think it was necessary.
