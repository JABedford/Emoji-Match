# Emoji Match
## Turn the cards, match the Emojis, save the day!

### I WANT TO PLAY IT!
Alright, alright! Steady mate! Play it on my Codepen --->https://codepen.io/JABedford/pen/vRrvwE
I will host it on my website as and when, but for now Codepen will do!

### About
The Emoji Match game is coursework for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. I was provided with a basic HTML and CSS file, and given a product specification and the rest is left up to the participant. I decided to go with Emojis as it was a bit more aesthetic than the standard icons provided.

### The Creation Process
#### First Submit
I had struggled in particular with a few elements of the Javascript section. My timer did not work as expected, and also it was possible to "cheat" the game and double click the cards to pass without having to match anything.

I also encountered an issue with the game not resetting properly when it was completed and therefore the cards did not reshuffle. I have been using a script from StackOverflow, but for some reason this
was not inititiating correctly.

Subsequently, it was picked up on in my code review. I was given a small piece of advice for each problem, but ultimately I decided to start from the start again and rewrite what I had done. I made this decision
purely for the fact that when trying to fix the various bugs throughout, I kept thinking of shorter ways of doing various things. This wasn't an easy decision seeing as I had already invested so much time
in doing the original script, however I think it was necessary.

#### Second Submit
I worked on the problems that were present in the first submittal. The HTML file I edited slightly, removed the modal box as I wasn't happy with how it looked. In my opinion it looked too clunky and
unpolished compared to the game board itself.

I created a flowchart and drew everything out by hand, which was something I didn't do in the first step. I halved my lines of code and thus created a much more efficient program.

Here is what my reviewer had to say:-
_"I liked playing your game very much. Everything looks so nice from starting of the game logic to modal display. Your effort can be seen from your project. You will really do great in future! Never stop learning and happy learning! :)
And, also always make handwritten notes or a flow chart which will be helpful to you to break your problem into small tasks and easier for you to find out what to execute next. Plus the modal display was really AWESOME! You shouldn't have changed it to alert boxes. ALthough it is also nice but modal gives a better view in the context of a game!
Anyways, you really did a great job. Keep up the good work! :)"_

Seems that maybe I was a bit quick to delete the modal boxes!! ;)

_"An EXCELLENT job is done with the README file. Really I am impressed! Two thumbs up!"_

What can I say!?
